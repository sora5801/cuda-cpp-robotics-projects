# download_data.ps1 — public-dataset fetcher for 01.01 (Full GPU image pipeline: debayer → undistort → rectify → resize → normalize, zero CPU copies)
#
# DECISION (not a placeholder): this project stays synthetic-only. No public
# dataset teaches this project's lesson better than an authored scene with
# EXACT, dense ground truth (the ideal rectified image AND the raw Bayer
# input are both derivable in closed form from one camera model — see
# ../scripts/make_synthetic.py's file header) — a real calibration dataset
# would only add licensing friction for no didactic gain. This script is an
# honest no-op, kept only so every project in the repo exposes the same
# script uniformly (CLAUDE.md paragraph 8).
#
# Repo policy (CLAUDE.md paragraph 8) for any real implementation here:
#   * Idempotent — safe to re-run; skip files that already exist with the
#     right checksum.
#   * Documented — source URL, expected size, SHA-256 checksum, and LICENSE
#     stated in comments here AND in ../data/README.md.
#   * License-respecting — non-commercial / no-redistribution datasets
#     (KITTI, nuScenes) get pointed at their official source with
#     instructions; registration walls are never bypassed; the committed
#     sample under ../data/sample/ stays synthetic in those cases.
#   * Downloads land in ../data/downloaded/ (git-ignored), NEVER in
#     ../data/sample/ (which holds only the tiny committed sample).
#
# Illustrative shape of a real fetch (kept as a comment on purpose):
#   $url      = 'https://example.org/dataset/tiny_subset.zip'   # official source
#   $expected = 'SHA256-HEX-HERE'                               # pin the bytes
#   $dest     = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot '..\data\downloaded\tiny_subset.zip'
#   if (-not (Test-Path $dest) -or
#       (Get-FileHash $dest -Algorithm SHA256).Hash -ne $expected) {
#       Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $dest               # ~123 MB
#       if ((Get-FileHash $dest -Algorithm SHA256).Hash -ne $expected) {
#           Write-Error 'checksum mismatch — refusing to use the file'
#       }
#   }
