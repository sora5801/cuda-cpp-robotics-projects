# download_data.sh — public-dataset fetcher for 27.01 (Molecular dynamics (mini-LAMMPS) of elastomers → soft-robot material models)
# (Linux/macOS twin of download_data.ps1 — keep the two in sync.)
#
# TEMPLATE PLACEHOLDER.
# TODO(scaffold): if a public dataset genuinely teaches more than synthetic
# data for this project, implement the fetch below; otherwise leave this
# script as the honest no-op it currently is.
#
# Repo policy (CLAUDE.md paragraph 8) for any real implementation here:
#   * Idempotent — safe to re-run; skip files that already exist with the
#     right checksum.
#   * Documented — source URL, expected size, SHA-256 checksum, and LICENSE
#     stated in comments here AND in ../data/README.md.
#   * License-respecting — non-commercial / no-redistribution datasets get
#     pointed at their official source; registration walls never bypassed;
#     the committed sample stays synthetic in those cases.
#   * Downloads land in ../data/downloaded/ (git-ignored), NEVER in
#     ../data/sample/.
#
# Illustrative shape of a real fetch (kept as a comment on purpose):
#   URL='https://example.org/dataset/tiny_subset.zip'    # official source
#   SHA='SHA256-HEX-HERE'                                # pin the bytes (~123 MB)
#   DEST="$(dirname "$0")/../data/downloaded/tiny_subset.zip"
#   mkdir -p "$(dirname "$DEST")"
#   if [ ! -f "$DEST" ] || ! echo "$SHA  $DEST" | sha256sum -c - >/dev/null 2>&1; then
#       curl -L -o "$DEST" "$URL"
#       echo "$SHA  $DEST" | sha256sum -c -   # hard-fail on checksum mismatch
#   fi
