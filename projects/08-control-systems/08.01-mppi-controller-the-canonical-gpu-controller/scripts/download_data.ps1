# download_data.ps1 — public-dataset fetcher for 08.01 (MPPI controller — the canonical GPU controller: cart-pole → quadrotor → AGV → off-road racer)
#
# 08.01 DECISION: no public dataset applies — a controller's input is a
# scenario (start state + duration), not recordings; noise, rollouts and
# the plant are generated in-demo from fixed seeds and verified against the
# CPU oracle. This script stays the honest no-op below;
# ../scripts/make_synthetic.py writes the scenario (see ../data/README.md).
#
# Repo policy (CLAUDE.md paragraph 8) for any real implementation here:
#   * Idempotent — safe to re-run; skip files that already exist with the
#     right checksum.
#   * Documented — source URL, expected size, SHA-256 checksum, and LICENSE
#     stated in comments here AND in ../data/README.md.
#   * License-respecting — non-commercial / no-redistribution datasets
#     (KITTI, nuScenes) get pointed at their official source with
#     instructions; registration walls are never bypassed; the committed
#     sample under ../data/sample/ stays synthetic in those cases.
#   * Downloads land in ../data/downloaded/ (git-ignored), NEVER in
#     ../data/sample/ (which holds only the tiny committed sample).
#
# Illustrative shape of a real fetch (kept as a comment on purpose):
#   $url      = 'https://example.org/dataset/tiny_subset.zip'   # official source
#   $expected = 'SHA256-HEX-HERE'                               # pin the bytes
#   $dest     = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot '..\data\downloaded\tiny_subset.zip'
#   if (-not (Test-Path $dest) -or
#       (Get-FileHash $dest -Algorithm SHA256).Hash -ne $expected) {
#       Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $dest               # ~123 MB
#       if ((Get-FileHash $dest -Algorithm SHA256).Hash -ne $expected) {
#           Write-Error 'checksum mismatch — refusing to use the file'
#       }
#   }
